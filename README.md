This is a webpage accompanying the invited talk *KyrgyzNLP: Challenges, Progress, and Future* given on October 18th, 2024 at the [AIST-2024](https://aistconf.org/) conference in Bishkek.

Here we present
* manually annotated topics of the papers,
* search interface for browsing the KyrgyzNLP papers used in the study,
* a co-authorship network (dynamic D3.js layout).

The paper is in the making; for now, if you use our work in your study, we'll be grateful if you cite it.
